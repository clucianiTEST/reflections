When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Specially when you work on team project and you share your work, also it helps to keep a backup in the cloud


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Usually if you are working in a feature in a project team  you prefer complete it before  share it  with the rest of the team. Or you want synchronize only the completed logical task and not the steps in between.
